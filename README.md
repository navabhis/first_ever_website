# first_ever_website
The website created meets the required objectives like a proper countdown clock by calculating the time difference from end date to the present by implementing basic math calculations and innerHTML property. The popup button was created by implementing 2 new functions openPopup() and closePopup() which add/remove open-popup class  in the css file which is adjusted in a way to show the popup when the preview button is clicked. The text (& images) are implemented into their respective classes and proper code for their size, position and color adjustment has been given in the css file. The required images are also given in the images folder in the file uploaded.

Thank You.
